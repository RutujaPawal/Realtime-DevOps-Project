Create Amazon EKS cluster by eksctl

Pre-requisites:

This Lab is using Jenkins EC2 instance. Jenkins EC2 instance needs to have following configured:

   1.Install AWS CLI – Command line tools for working with AWS services, including Amazon EKS.
   2.Install eksctl – A command line tool for working with EKS clusters that automates many individual tasks.
   3.Install kubectl  – A command line tool for working with Kubernetes clusters. 
   
Install AWS CLI
   
   Follow these steps from the command line to install the AWS CLI on Linux.

        curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip" 

        sudo apt install unzip

        sudo unzip awscliv2.zip  

        sudo ./aws/install

        aws --version

Install eksctl

      eksctl is a command line tool for working with EKS clusters that automates many individual tasks.

      The eksctl tool uses CloudFormation under the hood, creating one stack for the EKS master control plane and another stack for the worker nodes.

      Download and extract the latest release of eksctl with the following command.

      curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp

      Move the extracted binary to /usr/local/bin. 

      sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin

      eksctl version
      
Install kubectl

      Kubernetes uses a command line utility called kubectl for communicating with the cluster API server. It is tool for controlling Kubernetes clusters. kubectl looks for a file named config in the $HOME directory.
      
      sudo curl --silent --location -o /usr/local/bin/kubectl   https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-eks/1.22.6/2022-03-09/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl

      sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kubectl 
      
      kubectl version --short --client
